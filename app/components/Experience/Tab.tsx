        chatting with customers about what they needed to making
        sure their orders got fulfilled to keeping them coming
        back for more. I got to work with over 200 different
        clients, including some big names like Volkswagen,
        Amica, Braun, Å»abka, and even a foreign partner,
        FlexLink. One of my biggest responsibilities was to
        negotiate contracts with some really big players in the
        electrical manufacturing space, like Schenider, Eaton,
        Legrand, and Hager. So I`ve picked up some pretty strong
        contract negotiation and vendor management skills along
