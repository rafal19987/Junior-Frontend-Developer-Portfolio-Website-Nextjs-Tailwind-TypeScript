                back for more. I got to work with over 200 different
                clients, including some big names like Volkswagen,
                Amica, Braun, Å»abka, and even a foreign partner,
                FlexLink. One of my biggest responsibilities was to
                negotiate contracts with some really big players in the
                electrical manufacturing space, like Schenider, Eaton,
                Legrand, and Hager. So I`ve picked up some pretty strong
