          My career so far (3.5 years exp) has consisted mainly of contact with
          the client. I have had some really great experience in customer
          service, sales, and account management. In my last job as a Commercial
          Matters Specialist at TIM S.A., a big-time distributor of electrical
          goods in Poland, I had the whole sales process under my belt - from
          chatting with customers about what they needed to making sure their
          orders got fulfilled to keeping them coming back for more.

          Oh, and one more thing - I have also had some experience working in a
          hybrid system, which has helped me get pretty good at working
          remotely. So, overall, I think my background in sales and account
          management, coupled with my negotiation skills and remote work
          experience, could be a real asset to any team.
