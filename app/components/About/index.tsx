            a self-taught developer passionate about crafting websites and
            applications. Over the past year, I've honed my skills in front-end
            development, focusing on technologies like React, Next.js,
            TypeScript.

            My design process starts in Figma, where I meticulously plan and
            design projects before seamlessly transitioning to implementation.
            With a strong foundation in JavaScript, I'm at ease with various
            front-end frameworks, and I'm excited to explore Vue or Angular if
            the opportunity arises.
          </p>
          <p className='w-full'>
            I'm constantly eager to learn and open to new technologies. While
            mobile app development isn't my current focus, I aspire to delve
            into React Native in the future.

            I've gained valuable experience through personal projects and
            teamwork, contributing to two exciting ventures. Prior to my coding
            journey, I worked as a sales specialist in the electrical industry,
            serving wholesale clients.
